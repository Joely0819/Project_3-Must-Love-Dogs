# Project_3-Must-Love-Dogs
Our dog adoption dashboard will mirror the belly button biodiversity homework in a sense that we will provide the user with a drop down menu allowing them to choose from a variety of dog breeds. Once a breed is chosen, the dashboard will present the user with a variety of information pulled from the dog API and the petfinder API including, dog traits, weight, height, lifespan, and locations of adoption.
